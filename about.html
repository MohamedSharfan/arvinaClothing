      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Arvina began with a passion for style and a vision to make fashion more personal, inclusive, and affordable. 
        What started as a small idea among a few friends quickly grew into a brand that connects with people who love 
        expressing themselves through what they wear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every piece we create reflects our belief that fashion should be fun, fearless, and for everyone. From our first 
        collection to where we are now, we’ve stayed true to our values  offering high-quality clothes that inspire confidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, Arvina is more than just a clothing brand. It’s a community. And we’re just getting started.
